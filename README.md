## Goal

Achieve the best accuracy in a classification task with limited training time. 

### Key points

* 10 mins of training
* Small dataset: ~5000 images. Each image is 32*32
* Tests are run on 1 Nvidia V100 with 12GB of memory. 

### Delivrable

* Network architecture
* Training regime
* Data augmentation and preprocessing


## To DO

- [ ] Find a basline network to scale.
- [ ] Prepare the blackbox.
- [ ] Choose a data augmentation strategy: fixed/variable per epoch.
- [ ] Do we need Apex and Dali ? 
- [ ] Sample subsets of CIFAR-10
